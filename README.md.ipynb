    "- tensorflow python libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "#### 1. Attain and preprocess data\n",
    "- Download the [train](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/train.tar.gz) data and extract into a folder called **train**\n",
    "- Download the [test](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/test.tar.gz) data and extract into a folder called **test**\n",

    "### Requirements\n",
    "- A clone of [TensorFlow (0.9)](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)\n",
    "- TensorFlow building locally. [Instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.9/get_started/os_setup.html#download-and-setup)\n",
    "- TensorFlow freeze_graph built. [Instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/tools/freeze_graph.py#L27)\n",

    "### Steps\n",
    "#### 1. Freeze tensorflow model\n",
    "In order to use the model in an android app, you must freeze the weights into the model and copy this into the correct directory. To do this follow these steps,\n",
    "- Select the model that you would like to use in the android application. You will need that models **save_name** as recorded in the results and log file. It will be in the format **yy-mm-dd-hh-nn-ss**\n",
    "- Setup the local file **freeze_graph.sh** to point to your local version of tensorflow freeze_graph application\n",
    "- Setup the local file **freeze_graph.sh** to be executable\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check a file called **frozen_graph.pb** have been copiied into the **android/assets** directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Build and install android app\n",
    "To build and install the android app you will need to replace the tensorflow directory  **tensorflow/tensorflow/examples/android/** with the **android** directory in this repo. \n",
    "- To do this there are 2 options\n",
    " 1. Option 1, copy the local android directory over the tensorflow one.\n",
    " 2. Option 2, delete the android directory in tensorflow and use a symlink to the android folder in this repo.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "- Setup your device with adb to receive the application\n",
    "- Build and install the android demo as normal with these [instructions]( https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android), or run\n",
    "```bash\n",
